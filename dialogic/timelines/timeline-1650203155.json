But where to start...\nWell, the way those weird... things keep shooting at you remind you of something.\nA few years ago, when you would still call yourself a young lady, you were really into... Arcade shooting games.\nYou're really grateful for the skills you got from them.\nYou wouldn't be getting any resemblance of peaceful sleep otherwise.\nAnyways, hat's really the only \"lead\" you've got.\n... Assuming there's anything to investigate in the first place.\nYou hope there is. You've been in need of a distraction from life."
