It doesn't matter.\nYou have repeatedly broke the balance of this world.\nHow did you even get here? I haven't seen your actual dream self in ages.\nI've been trying to fix this situation by getting her back here, you know.\nBut if that won't suffice, I can stop you from dreaming entirely.\nAnd you leave me no other choice.\nGood night."
